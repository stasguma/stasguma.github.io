2. Project - html, css, javascript, websocket.

This poject is an advertising platform that enables major advertisers to engage with interested internet users through bespoke chatbot interactions.
The platform includes a chatbot builder and analytics. The platform serves two kinds of users; planners and clients. Planners mainly use the platform to create new chatbots, and clients use it to access overview tables and approve or disapprove a chatbot.
The chatbot can be of two formats such as a standalone widget and inline.

The main task was to make a chatbot builder. I have used several third-party jQuery plugins which are designed for flowcharts and adapted them to the assigned tasks. I have thought over the connection between the components and provided the communication with a help of WebSocket.
