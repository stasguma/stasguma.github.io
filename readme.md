   This project will be an example of how to create a large-scale project with clean code. Project based on a Feature-Sliced Design methodology. Currently it doesn't have much functionality. In the future it will have all the basic features that most projects have.

   Don't pay too much attention to the design, that's not the point of this project. Maybe in the future it'll be enhanced.

   This poject is an advertising platform that enables major advertisers to engage with interested internet users through bespoke chatbot interactions.
   The platform includes a chatbot builder and analytics. The platform serves two kinds of users; planners and clients. Planners mainly use the platform to create new chatbots, and clients use it to access overview tables and approve or disapprove a chatbot.
   The chatbot can be of two formats such as a standalone widget and inline.

   The main task was to make a chatbot builder. I have used several third-party jQuery plugins which are designed for flowcharts and adapted them to the assigned tasks. I have thought over the connection between the components and provided the communication with a help of WebSocket.
